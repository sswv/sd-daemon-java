1. Copy `sd-daemon-java.jar` into the `lib` directory of Hadoop, and copy 
`libsd-daemon-java.so` into the `lib/native/<arch>` directory of Hadoop.

2. Apply the patch to Hadoop: `hdfs-sd-daemon-java.patch`. Apply the patch to 
Hadoop or your client application with Hadoop code: `DFSClient.patch`.

3. Build Hadoop, and use the new `hadoop-*-core.jar` instead of the original 
one after building.

4. Modify the configuration of Hadoop, setting 
`dfs.client.max.block.acquire.failures` a relatively big value, such as 50.

5. Modify the `start-dfs.sh` script of Hadoop, adding this line at the end:
`"$bin"/hadoop dfsadmin -safemode leave`. (for experiment only, unsafe!)

6. Copy `setaside-hdfs.service` and `setaside-hdfs.socket` into 
`/etc/systemd/system` or other configuration directory of systemd, and modify 
them according to your Hadoop's configuration.

7. Try to start the socket unit: `systemctl start setaside-hdfs.socket`.
